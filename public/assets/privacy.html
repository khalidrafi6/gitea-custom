  <h2>What Personal Data I Collect?</h2>

I collect this data to gather general statistics about audience. However, if you have <b>Do Not Track</b> enabled in your browser, this data will not be collected. To know what data I (and in turn Simple Analytics) collect, read <a href="https://docs.simpleanalytics.com/what-we-collect">this</a>.
